tvshow_downloader.py
class TVShowConfigurationParser:
 - Added conf_file property to know what file was used from external objects to TVShowConfiguratorParser
	* getGlobal -- Added option to getGlobal config without having to change inner code
	* get_confFile -- conf file location
	* parser property to access the parser from other object's 

 - Added a connection to a event dispatcher and Event Listeners class witch can be used 
	to add new event listeners without touching the main file
	you can call your downloader from here making a syscall instead of using a run.sh

 - I injected the TVShowConfiguratorParser object to the EventListeners Object
	to make it easy to access configuration values

class Episode:
	- Inject the eventDispatcher
	- has a magnet info field for magnet url and a set_magnet method

 DownloadEvent.py 
	- This list's the download Events by extending the Event in EventDispatcher.py
	  and added a name property

EventDispatcher.py
	-  Created by Daniele Esposti on Tue, 19 Oct 2010 (MIT)

Mailer.py
	- Simple object to send e-mails basically a copy paste from the tutorial
	  with few changes

MailerListener.py
	- I wanted to get e-mail warning when a new show is available my online computer
	  is not the same has my download computer
	- All options must be placed (can be empty) on the config file for this to work
	-
